This is the personal website of Karl Kedrovsky.

Professionally I'm currently working at [VML](https://www.vml.com), an interactive agency, as a Group Director of Technology. I manage a group of technologists that do things like website builds and CMS implementations. I'm mostly focused on delivering content management solutions using Drupal but I also have extensive experience in application architecture and Java/JEE development. I also do a fair amount of technical consulting, help manage the overall software development and architecture practice within VML and co-organize the local [Drupal user group](https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Kansas-City-Drupal-User-Group/).

Personally I'm a Christian, husband (one wife - Martha) and father (two daughters - Abigail and Julia). We live in Overland Park KS, a suburb of Kansas City.

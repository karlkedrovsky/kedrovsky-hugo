This is the personal website of Karl Kedrovsky.

Professionally I'm currently working at [VMLY&R](https://www.vmlyr.com), a global brand and customer experience agency, as a Managing Director of Technology. I manage multiple groups of technologists that execute custom website projects and CMS implementations. I'm mostly focused on delivering content management solutions using Drupal but I also have extensive experience in application architecture and Java/JEE development. I also do a fair amount of technical consulting, help manage the overall software development and architecture practice within VMLY&R and co-organize the local [Drupal user group](https://www.meetup.com/Greater-Kansas-City-Drupal-User-Group/).

Personally I'm a Christian, husband (one wife - Martha) and father (two daughters - Abigail and Julia). We live in Overland Park KS, a suburb of Kansas City.

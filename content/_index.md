This is the personal website of Karl Kedrovsky.

Professionally I&rsquo;m currently working at
[VMLY&amp;R](https://www.vmlyr.com), a global brand and customer experience
agency, as a Managing Director of Technology and Solutions Architect. I manage
multiple teams that provide technical solutions and implementations to meet our
clients business needs, primarily executing custom website projects and CMS
implementations. I provide organizational leadership, help manage the overall
software development practice, and manage relationships with internal teams,
clients, and technology partners. Technically I'm focused on open source
solutions, with Drupal being the most common CMS platform, and I have extensive
experience in enterprise and application architecture and manage projects
throughout the software development lifecycle.

Personally I'm a Christian, husband (one wife - Martha) and father (two daughters - Abigail and Julia). We live in Overland Park KS, a suburb of Kansas City.
